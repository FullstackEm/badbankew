Capstone project for MIT fullstack professional certificate program
Description/Motivation: This project is my effort at developing a full-stack application using the MERN stack following the directions from the MIT professional certificate in full-stadck development. This is a simple application that gave me more exposure of how to get the front end talking to the back end.
Installation Guidelines: to start this application use npm init -y and then npm node.js. For now you will have to start a server, but once it's been deployed, I will include a link to the hosted site.
Technology Used: JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, Bootstrap, and Express. 
Features: Currently include Create Account, Login, Balance, Deposit, Withdraw and All_data. The app still needs security, a logout feature.
